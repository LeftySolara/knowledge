# Networking Devices

## What is a Network?

A **computer network** is a communications network which allows nodes to share resources.

### What is a Node?

Network nodes include:
- routers
- switches
- firewalls
- servers
- client machines

## Node Types

### Clients

A **client** is a device that accesses a service made available by a server. These are regular computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.

### Servers

**Servers** are devices that provide services for clients.

### Switches

A **switch** is a device that connects other devices on a LAN. Note that they do _not_ provide connectivity between LANs or over the Internet.

### Routers

**Routers** are devices that provide connectivity between LANs. Thus, they are used to send/receive data over the Internet.

### Firewalls

A **firewall** is a security device that monitors and controls network traffic. Must be configured with security rules to determine what should be allowed and what should be blocked.
