# C Data Types

C provides several different data types, including:

- `int`: integers
- `float`: a floating-point number
- `char`: a character (one byte)
  - These are stored internally as a bit pattern, so any integer type can be used for character data.
- `short`: short integer
- `long`: long integer
- `double`: double-precision floating point number

The sizes of these types are machine-dependent.

## Arrays

## Strings

In C, strings are just arrays of characters.
