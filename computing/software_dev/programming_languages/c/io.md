# Input and Output

C has a simple model of I/O provided by the standard library.

## Character I/O

Text I/O, regargless of its origin or destination, is dealt with as streams of characters. A _text stream_ is a sequence of characters divided into lines.

The standard library [provides several functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io) for reading characters.
