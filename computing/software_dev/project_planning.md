# Planning a Gamedev Project (WIP)

This is a list of tips for planning out a game development project. It's a combination of information I've learned from others as well as lessons I've learned through my own experience.

There is no one right way to plan a project. Everyone is different and has their own way of doing things. What I detail in this article may work well for some people, but not for others.

## Steps

Generally, planning a project involves the following steps:

1. Decide on an idea for your game
2. Figure out your strengths and weaknesses

### Decide on an idea (and stick with it!)

Most of us have a number of different game ideas floating around in our heads. That's great! Allowing your creativity to flow can make you a better developer. However, you do need to be careful with this.

If you're anything like me, then you've probably spent a lot of time jumping from project to project as new ideas form. Because of this, you've likely never actually *finished* a project, have you? It's hard to finish things when you're constantly dropping them for other things.

As a developer with ADHD, I understand how tempting it can be to switch your focus to some new thing every other day. But if you want to actually finish a project, then you have to accept the cold, hard truth: **you need to decide on one idea to pursue and stick with it**. Doing this can be difficult and requires a lot of discipline, but it's a requirement for producing tangible results.

### Figure out your strengths and weaknesses
