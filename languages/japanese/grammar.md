# ぶんぽう (Grammar)

## XはYです

You can say things like "I am a musician" or "My major is Japanese" by using the pattern **XはYです**. For example:

> 学生です。*(I am) a student.*

> 本語です。*(My major) is Japanese.*

You'll notice that there are no subjects in these sentences like in English. That's because Japanese speakers tend to omit them when it's clear who or what they are talking about.

An example of a sentence with a subject:

> ジュリアンヌさんは学生です。*Julianne is a student.*

The は in these sentences is what's referred to as a **particle** and is pronounced "wa". Particles attach themselves to phrases and indicate how the phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.

## Question Sentences

To turn a sentence into a question, simply add か to the end of it. Note that it is not customary to write a question mark.

> ジュリアンヌさんは学生ですか。 *Is Julianne a student?*

There are sometimes "question words" that these types of sentences might contain. The question word for "what" has two pronunciations: なん and なに. なん is used right before です or a counter. なに is used before a particle.

## nounのnoun

The particle の is used to connect two nouns. It can act as the possessive or be used to make a noun more specific.

Example of being the possessive:

> ジュリアンヌさんの本  *Julianne's book*

Example of making a noun more specific:

> 大学の先生 *A college professor*

## これ　それ　あれ　どれ

これ, それ, あれ, and どれ are used to talk about things we don't know the name of. They are similar to "this" and "that" in English.

**これ** refers to a thing that is close to you:

> これはかばんです。*This is a bag.*

**それ** refers to a thing that is close to the person you're speaking to:

> それはたけしさんのさいふです。*That is Takeshi's wallet.*

**あれ** refers to something the is not close to the listener or the speaker:

> あれはジュリアンヌのじてんしゃです。*That is Julianne's bike over there.*

**どれ** means "which". When using it, が must be the following particle in question sentences.

> どれがジュリアンヌさんの自転車ですか。*Which one is Julianne's bike?*

## この　その　あの　どの　+　noun

この, その, あの, and どの are more specific than これ, それ, あれ, and どれ. Use these when you know what something is. Again, in question sentences you must use が as the following particle.

> このかばんは高いですね。　*This bag is expensive.*

> そのかばんが高いですか。　*Is that bag expensive?*

> あのかばんは高いですね。　*That bag over there is expensive.*

> どのかばんが高いですか。　*Which bag is expensive?*

## ここ　そこ　あそこ　どこ

These words represent places.

**ここ** basically means "here"; some place near the speaker:

> ジュリアンヌさんの自転車はここです。　*Julianne's bike is here.*

**そこ** means "there"; some place close to the listener:

> ジュリアンヌさんの自転車はそこです。　*Julianne's bike is there.*

**あそこ** essentially means "over there"; somewhere away from both the speaker and the listener:

> ジュリアンヌさんの家はあそこです。　*Julianne's house is over there.*

**どこ** means "where":

> ジュリアンヌさんの家はどこですか。　*Where is Julianne's house?*

## たれのnoun

The pattern **だれの\<noun>** is used to ask who something belongs to.

> これはだれのかばんですか。　*Whose bag is this?*
