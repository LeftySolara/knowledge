# Arrays

Arrays are basic data structures used to store collections of data sequentially.

Features of arrays are:
- Elements can be accessed randomly (identified by indexes)
- Can have one or more dimensions
- Fixed capacity


## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are the same as arrays, but with variable capacity.
An example of this is the `vector` type in C++.
