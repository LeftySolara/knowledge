# Arrays

Arrays are basic data structures used to store collections of data sequentially.

Features of arrays are:
- Elements can be accessed randomly (identified by indexes)
- Can have one or more dimensions
- Fixed capacity


## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are the same as arrays, but with variable capacity.
An example of this is the `vector` type in C++.

## 2D Arrays

2D arrays are used to represent rectangular grids. They are usually implemented as an array of arrays.

In some languages, these are implemented internally as one-dimensional arrays, and in some others there's no multidimensional arrays at all.
