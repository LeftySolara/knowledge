# Getting Things Done

Getting Things Done is a time management methodology described in [David Allen's famous book of the same name](https://gettingthingsdone.com/). Below is my understanding of how GTD works and some descriptions of how I implement it in my own life.

## Overview

There are a lot of things that enter my mind throughout the day \(inputs\) and I need to decide what to do with them \(outputs\). Inputs can be things like phone numbers to remember, errands that need to be run, or meetings to attend. Outputs would be things like putting events in my calendar or adding tasks to my to-do list.

The goal is to capture all my inputs and put them into a trusted system so I can deal with them later on. This removes the burden of having to remember everything.

## Steps

There are five basic steps to the GTD methodology: 1. Capture 2. Clarify 3. Organize 4. Reflect 5. Engage

### Capture - Collect what has your attention

This one is simple. I just make sure to note down _everything_ that comes to mind as an input. It doesn't matter where this info is kept, as long as all of it gets captured. In my case, I write everything in my [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/).

### Clarify - Process what it means

Once everything is collected in my inbox, I take some time to process it all and decide what to do with each input. This needs to be done regularly, as letting a backlog accumulate will just make this more difficult.

I usually do this once or twice a day. It helps remove friction from the system.

### Organize - Put it where it belongs

Once I know what something is, it gets put in its proper place. Here is where things usually end up:

- If it's something actionable, it goes into my task management system. I use [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) for this.
- If it's time-sensitive, it goes on my calendar.
- If it's reference material I might need later, it goes into my personal notes or on this wiki. For this I keep a collection of local Markdown files that sync between my machines. For file sync I use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).
- If it's not important, it gets trashed and I don't think about it anymore.

This is also where contexts come in. A _context_ is basically just a tool, thing, place, or person you need to get something done. For example, I have a "home" context for things that need to be done at home or a "phone" context for all the calls I need to make. Other contexts include work, school, my PC, etc.

### Reflect - Review frequently

Each week I like to take time to clean up and maintain my lists. Skipping this just allows things to pile up, which defeats the whole purpose of have a system in the first place.

### Engage - Simply do

I think this one speaks for itself.
