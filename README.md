# My Knowledge Base

This is my personal documentation collection where I share most of my knowledge in the form of an online GitBook hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/LeftySolara/knowledge).

The articles in this gitbook are digital copies of my own personal notes. Thus, some information may be inaccurate. If you notice that any of my statements are incorrect, please [send me an email](mailto:julianne@julianneadams.info) and let me know.

This wiki is heavily inspired by [Nikita Voloboev's](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge).
